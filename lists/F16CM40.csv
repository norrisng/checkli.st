-GROUP-,LANDING
-INFO-,NORMAL LANDING
-INFO-,Fly initial at 300 knots.At the break, retard throttle and open speedbrakes as required. On downwind, when airspeed is below 300 knots, lower the LG. During base turn, recheck the LG down and slow to computed final approach airspeed to arrive on final at 11 to 13 degrees AOA. Check speedbrakes open and maintain computed final approach airspeed/AOA on final. Rate of descent decreases slightly when entering ground effect. Reduce thrust gradually to continue the descent while applying back stick to reduce sink rate to the minimum practical. Thrust can be reduced sooner during an 11 degree approach than during a 13 degree approach. In either case, maintain a maximum of 13 degrees AOA while reducing sink rate to the minimum practical.
-INFO-,Use two point aerodynamic braking until approximately 100 knots, then fly the nosewheel to runway. maximum effective two point aerodynamic braking is achieved at 13 degrees AOA. An AOA less than 11 degrees results in significantly reduced two point aerodynamic braking. Although two point aerodynamic braking is effective as low as 80 knots, runway length and condition should be used to determine when, after decelerating to 100 knots, to lower the nose to the hree point attitude.
-INFO-,After the nosewheel is on the runway, open the speedbrakes fully and maintain full aft stick for maximum three point aerodynamic braking and wheel braking effectiveness.
-INFO-,Smoothly apply moderate to heavy braking to decelerate to taxi speed. Using less than moderate braking increases the likelihood of a hot brake(s). NWS should not be engaged above taxi speed unless required to prevent departure from prepared runway surface.
-GROUP-,AFTER LANDING
-INFO-,Do not use parking brake within 30 minutes after a normal landing. Use only chocks, if available, or minimum possibly pressure to hld the aircraft stationary.
